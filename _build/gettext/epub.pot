msgid "Starting with version 1.6, pandoc can produce output in the `EPUB`_ electronic book format. EPUB books can be viewed on iPads, Nooks, and other electronic book readers, including many smart phones. (They can also be converted to Kindle books using the GUI only `KindlePreviewer`_ on Windows and Mac OSX. `KindleGen`_ – which offers a command line interface and supports `Linux`_, `Mac OSX`_ and `Windows`_ – has been deprecated, but binaries can still be found on the internet.)"

#: ../../epub.rst:99
msgid "This command will create a working directory called ``progit`` on your machine. The actual markdown sources for the English version of the book are in the ``en`` subdirectory, so start by changing to that directory:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../epub.rst:107
msgid "As you can see, each chapter is a single text file in its own directory. Chacon does some postprocessing on these files, for example, to insert images. This is a placeholder for Figure 1-1, for example:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../epub.rst:116
msgid "The actual image file is called ``18333fig0101-tn.png`` and lives in the ``figures`` subdirectory of the repository, as you can verify."
msgstr ""

#: ../../epub.rst:119
msgid "For demonstration purposes, we want pure markdown files, so let’s change this placeholder into a markdown image link. Pandoc will treat a paragraph containing a single image as a figure with a caption, which is what we want:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../epub.rst:128
msgid "We can make this change in all the files with a perl one-liner:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../epub.rst:136

#: ../../epub.rst:140
msgid "OK! Now we’re almost ready to make an ebook. We have the chapters, each in its own file, but we still need a title. Create a file, ``title.txt``, with a pandoc YAML metadata block:"
